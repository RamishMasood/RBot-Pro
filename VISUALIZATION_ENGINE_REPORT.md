# RBot Pro: Signal Visualization Engine (2026 Edition)

## Overview
The trading bot has been upgraded with a professional-grade chart visualization engine, similar to TradingView. This allows users to see exactly why a trade was triggered and where the signal occurred.

## New Features

### 1. Signal Candle Visualization
- **BUY/SELL Arrows**: Large, high-visibility arrows are now drawn directly at the candle that triggered the signal.
- **Dynamic Coloring**: Green arrows for LONG, Red arrows for SHORT.
- **Direct Labeling**: "BUY" or "SELL" text labels appear next to the arrows for instant recognition.

### 2. Multi-Indicator Series Drawing
Instead of static support/resistance lines, the bot now plots full indicator series over historical bars:
- **TEMA (Triple EMA)**: Smooth trend-following line.
- **KAMA (Kaufman Adaptive MA)**: Adaptive line that flattens during noise.
- **ZLSMA (Zero Lag SMA)**: Ultra-fast trend tracking.
- **PSAR (Parabolic SAR)**: Dots/Line showing trend reversal points.
- **EMA 200**: Standard long-term trend context.
- **Chandelier Exit**: Trailing stop-loss visualization.

### 3. Tactical Confluence Markers
Specific reason-based markers appear on the chart when confluences are detected:
- **SQZ BRK (Squeeze Break)**: Blue/Green circles indicating volatility expansion.
- **TRND (Trend Alignment)**: Directional indicators confirming multiple timeframe alignment.

## Technical Implementation
- **Backend (`fast_analysis.py`)**: Modified core indicator functions to return full `series` data (last 200 bars). Added `format_series_for_chart` helper to prepare data for the frontend.
- **Frontend (`advanced_script.js`)**: Enhanced `plotAnalysisData` to use `chart.addLineSeries()` for dynamic lines and `series.setMarkers()` for signal arrows and confluences.
- **Data Transfer**: `analysis_data` payload now includes optimized {time, value} objects, minimizing bandwidth while providing rich visual context.

## Verified Strategies
The following strategies are now fully "Visual-Ready":
- PSAR-TEMA Scalp
- KAMA-Volatility Scalp
- VFI Momentum Scalp
- ZLSMA Fast Scalp (Coming soon)
- Squeeze Breakout (Coming soon)
